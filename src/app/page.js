      <h1>Conditional Layout</h1>
      <p>
      In Next.js 13, a conditional layout allows you to dynamically choose which layout to display based on certain conditions. This is particularly useful when you want to display different layouts for different user states or routes, such as whether a user is authenticated or for a particular pathname etc.
